Levels of syntax
Computer language syntax is generally distinguished into three levels:

Words – the lexical level, determining how characters form tokens;
Phrases – the grammar level, narrowly speaking, determining how tokens form phrases;
Context – determining what objects or variables names refer to, if types are valid, etc.
